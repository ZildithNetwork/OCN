    # Mongoid does not provide an "abstract document" mechanism, so this is
    # an ad-hoc implementation of it. PlayerStat is not a Document itself,
    # but when it's included in a Class, it brings Document with it as well
    # as the declarations in the method below.
    #
    # This is used to create different PlayerStat models for different time
    # spans, each stored in a different collection.
    #
    # It would be nice if Mongoid did this itself when you include Document
    # in another module, but doing that just raises an error.
